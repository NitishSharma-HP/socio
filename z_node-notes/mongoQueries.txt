----------------------------------CREATE VS SAVE--------------------------------

.create() is a one-liner that both creates and saves the document.
.save() requires you to first create an instance of the model (using new) and then explicitly save it.

.create() returns the saved document after it has been created and saved.
.save() also returns the saved document, but it only saves an already created instance.
