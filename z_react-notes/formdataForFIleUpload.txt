Why use FormData?

Binary Data Handling: FormData is specifically designed to handle binary data, such as files.
You can't simply send a file as part of a JSON object, because files need to be encoded in a way that
the server can interpret them correctly (e.g., multipart/form-data encoding).

Multipart Form Submission: FormData automatically formats the data as multipart/form-data,
which is the standard way browsers submit forms containing file inputs.

let newFormData = new FormData();
        newFormData.append('name', formData.name);
        newFormData.append('image', formData.image);
        
console.log(newFormData)  //won't work

The FormData object is meant for sending data with POST requests, but it doesn't automatically 
serialize into a simple object or string that console.log would show in the console.
        
         newFormData.forEach((value, key) => { 
             console.log(key, value);
         });
