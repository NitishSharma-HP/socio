You can pass additional data via the state property when navigating.
This is a common approach in react-router-dom. Here's how you can do it:


you can pass data through the navigate function's second argument (which is the state):-
const dataToPass = { someProp: 'value' };
navigate('/add-category', { state: dataToPass });  // prop name should be state


Accessing the Props in the Destination Component
In the component you're navigating to (AddCategory in this case),
you can access the state passed via navigate using the useLocation hook from react-router-dom:

import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
const location = useLocation();
const data = location.state; // This is the data passed from the previous component
