Prefix with REACT_APP_: React requires that all environment variables used in the app start with the REACT_APP_ prefix. 
Any variable without this prefix will be ignored by React.

No spaces around the = sign: Make sure the assignment does not have spaces 
(e.g., KEY = value is incorrect, but KEY=value is correct).



In Node.js, if you want to load environment variables from a .env file (which is common for local development), 
you do need to install a package like dotenv to help with this.

For React, if you are using Create React App (CRA), you do not need to install any package like dotenv.
CRA automatically reads the .env file during the build process.
