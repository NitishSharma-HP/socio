React re-executes the custom hook every time the component renders. This is true for both functional components and custom hooks.

In general, if your new state depends on the old state (like appending to an array), it’s better to use the function 
form of setState (setToasts((prevState) => ...)) to ensure you’re always using the most up-to-date version of the state.
